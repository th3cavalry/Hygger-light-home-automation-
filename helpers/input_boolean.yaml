# Hygger Aquarium Light Helper Entities - Boolean Input
# This boolean helper controls special lighting effects
# It serves as a user-controllable toggle for advanced features
#
# Creation Instructions:
# 1. Go to Settings > Devices & Services > Helpers
# 2. Create "Toggle" helper with settings shown below
# 3. Configure with exact entity ID for automation compatibility
#
# IMPORTANT: Entity ID must match exactly for automations to work
# This helper is referenced by the main lighting automation

input_boolean:
  # Lightning Effect Controller
  # Enables/disables automatic lightning effects during storms
  # When enabled, system will create dramatic lightning flashes during stormy weather
  enable_aquarium_lightning:
    name: "Enable Aquarium Lightning"
    icon: mdi:weather-lightning        # Lightning bolt icon
    initial: false                     # Default state (disabled for safety)

# Usage Notes:
# - Toggle ON to enable lightning effects during storm weather
# - Toggle OFF to disable special effects (standard lighting only)
# - Lightning effects only trigger when weather conditions indicate storms
# - Effects are automatically coordinated with weather forecast data
# - Manual toggle allows user control over dramatic lighting changes
#
# Safety Considerations:
# - Default OFF prevents unexpected bright flashes
# - User must explicitly enable for lightning effects
# - Can be toggled during operation without restarting automations
