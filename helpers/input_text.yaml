  # Weather Forecast Cache Storage
  # Stores JSON-formatted weather forecast data as backup
  # Enables system to continue operating during API outages or rate limits
  aquarium_forecast_cache:
    name: "Aquarium Forecast Cache"
    max: 8192                          # Maximum characters (sufficient for JSON forecast data)  
    initial: ""                        # Start with empty cache

# Technical Details:
# - Stores JSON weather data from OpenWeatherMap API calls
# - Updated automatically by forecast caching automation
# - Used as fallback when live API calls fail or timeout
# - Contains hourly forecast data for lighting calculations
# - Format: JSON with weather conditions and timestamps
#
# Cache Management:
# - Automatically refreshed every 30 minutes by automation
# - Falls back to cached data during API failures
# - Ensures lighting system remains functional during network issues
# - Manual clearing not recommended (will disable weather-based lighting)
#
# Troubleshooting:
# - If cache appears empty, check weather integration setup
# - Verify OpenWeatherMap API key is valid and active
# - Check automation logs for cache update failures
