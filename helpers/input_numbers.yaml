# Hygger Aquarium Light Helper Entities - Number Inputs
# These number helpers track the virtual state of each color channel
# They serve as the "memory" for the lighting system, storing current levels
# 
# Creation Instructions:
# 1. Go to Settings > Devices & Services > Helpers
# 2. Create "Number" helper for each channel below
# 3. Configure with exact settings shown
#
# IMPORTANT: Entity IDs must match exactly for automations to work
# These helpers are referenced by all scripts and automations

input_number:
  # White Channel Level Controller
  # Controls the brightness of the white LED channel (0-10 scale)
  # Used for primary illumination and daylight simulation
  hygger_white_level:
    name: "Hygger White Level"
    min: 0                           # Minimum value (off)
    max: 10                          # Maximum value (full brightness)
    step: 1                          # Increment step size
    mode: slider                     # Display as slider in UI
    icon: mdi:lightbulb-outline      # White lightbulb icon
    unit_of_measurement: "level"     # Unit display
    
  # Red Channel Level Controller  
  # Controls the brightness of the red LED channel (0-10 scale)
  # Used for sunrise/sunset effects and warm lighting

  # Green Channel Level Controller
  # Controls the brightness of the green LED channel (0-10 scale)
  # Used for natural color balance and plant growth simulation

    unit_of_measurement: "level"     # Unit display
    
  # Blue Channel Level Controller
  # Controls the brightness of the blue LED channel (0-10 scale)
  # Used for deep water effects and cool lighting tones
  hygger_blue_level:
    name: "Hygger Blue Level"
    min: 0                           # Minimum value (off)
    max: 10                          # Maximum value (full brightness)
    step: 1                          # Increment step size

    icon: mdi:lightbulb-outline      # Blue lightbulb icon
    unit_of_measurement: "level"     # Unit display

# Notes for Advanced Configuration:
# - These helpers can be manually adjusted for testing
# - Values are automatically updated by the lighting automations
# - Manual changes will be overridden by the next automation cycle
# - For permanent manual control, disable the main automation first
