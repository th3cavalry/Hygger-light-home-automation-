# Hygger Remote Settings Issue - Solution Summary

## Problem Statement
User reported that Hygger HG016 remote (FCC ID: 2A6Qk-HG016) commands are not working as expected:
- `red_up` shows no change
- `red_down` shows teal instead of dimmer red  
- `green_up` shows teal instead of green
- `blue_down` turns off lights instead of dimming blue

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue stems from IR command learning problems where:
1. Physical remote buttons may not correspond to their expected functions
2. IR learning process may have captured incorrect or interfering signals
3. Different Hygger HG016 hardware batches may have different IR codes
4. Remote buttons might be mislabeled or have non-standard mappings

## Solution Provided

### 1. Diagnostic Tools Created
- **`diagnose_remote_commands.py`**: Comprehensive diagnostic tool that analyzes the issue and provides step-by-step troubleshooting
- **`scripts/aquarium_button_mapper.yaml`**: Home Assistant script for systematic button testing

### 2. Documentation Added
- **`REMOTE_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`**: Detailed troubleshooting guide specifically for remote command issues
- Updated **`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`** with new remote command section
- Updated setup guides with references to new troubleshooting resources

### 3. Systematic Solution Process
The solution provides a methodical approach:

1. **Delete Broken Commands**: Remove non-working IR commands from Broadlink
2. **Manual Button Testing**: Systematically test each physical button to document actual effects
3. **Create Button Mapping**: Map physical buttons to their actual light effects
4. **Re-learn Commands**: Learn commands using buttons that produce the desired effects
5. **Validation**: Test new commands and run full test sequence

### 4. Tools and Scripts

#### Diagnostic Script Usage:
```bash
python3 diagnose_remote_commands.py
```

#### Button Mapper Script:
- Import `scripts/aquarium_button_mapper.yaml` into Home Assistant
- Use to test individual commands: `remote.send_command` with specific command names
- Documents results via system logs and notifications

#### Home Assistant Commands:
```yaml
# Delete broken command
service: remote.delete_command
target:
  entity_id: remote.rm4_pro_remote
data:
  device: hygger_hg016
  command: red_up

# Learn new command  
service: remote.learn_command
target:
  entity_id: remote.rm4_pro_remote
data:
  device: hygger_hg016
  command: red_up

# Test command
service: remote.send_command
target:
  entity_id: remote.rm4_pro_remote
data:
  device: hygger_hg016
  command: red_up
```

## Implementation Benefits

### For Users:
- **Clear diagnosis**: Understand exactly what's wrong and why
- **Step-by-step guidance**: No guesswork - systematic troubleshooting process
- **Validation tools**: Confirm fixes work before proceeding
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for current and future issues

### For the Project:
- **Scalable solution**: Works for various remote command issues, not just this specific case
- **Educational**: Helps users understand IR learning process

## Success Criteria
The solution is successful when:
- ✅ All color channels respond correctly to their commands
- ✅ `red_up` increases red intensity (not "no change")  
- ✅ `red_down` decreases red intensity (not "shows teal")
- ✅ `green_up` increases green intensity (not "shows teal")
- ✅ `blue_down` decreases blue intensity (not "turns off lights")
- ✅ "Aquarium Test Lights" script completes successfully
- ✅ User understands the troubleshooting process for future issues
